### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my github!
The names Adam Cooley, and I'm a Systems Engineer @ Facebook. I work on a variety of Network Projects spanning hardware & software for Edge & Network Services. I develop in python & go, haven't really contributed much to the opensource community but I want to change that this year. I've got experience with django, flask, and php, mostly focused on backend services. I've also done some product development work during the introduction of network products to the opencompute project. I was an early contributor in building out the Express Backbone for Facebook, and lead the deployment engineering teams globally supporting the rollout. Arista networks rolled out a new network platform the 7368X based on a discussion I had with them in Dublin cerca Q3/Q4 2018, to partner with us on the OCP project and help develop and contribute designs that would further contribute to the disagregation of hardware and software we've been pushing for a while.

I've been in the networking, systems, and software business for 20~ years, worked for a variety of ISPs and a consulting leading up to a few years with Juniper Networks before ultimately landing at Facebook for the past 7 years.

Here's some interesting posts talking about projects I've been involved in, maybe check them out? There's some super cool stuff going on in the community, you won't want to miss out!
